# St. Louis R users group August 7, 2019

**Before the workshop:** 

- Make sure you have R and R Studio installed on the laptop you will use
- Make a new folder on the laptop you will bring
- Save the workshop R Markdown file, `08072019-rug-workshop-rmarkdown.Rmd`, in the folder 
- Make a subfolder called "data" inside the folder
- You should now have a folder with two things inside it: 
    + The R Markdown file 
    + An empty subfolder called "data"
- Install the following packages: haven, tidyverse, tableone
    
**After completing the above, if you want to save time and avoid potential trouble connecting to wireless you can also...**

- Open the .Rmd you saved and run the code chunk from line 33 to 51 (this may take a few minutes to run)

**I would recommend also downloading the codebook and the article we will be referring to in the workshop and making sure you can open them:** 

- Codebook: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2014/pdf/CODEBOOK14_LLCP.pdf 
- The article is saved in this repository and called `transgender-health-brfss.pdf`

**The slides are available here:**
